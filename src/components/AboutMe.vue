          Hi there, I'm Clarence!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer based in Melbourne, VIC.

        I believe that software is unparalleled in its ability to communicate ideas, stories, and possibilities with a much larger reach than any other medium. In doing so, it has the power to educate society on what was and what could be.

        I graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Software Engineering in 2020. Full-stack web development and mobile app development are my main areas of focus in my career, though I have done a fair bit of work in Python.

        I have experience working as an Industry-Based Learning Intern at National Australia Bank where I worked alongside experienced engineers to design and implement microservices for internal banking processes. I have also had experience building a full-stack web application for my Final Year Project at university for a commercial client where I built an anonymised-tracking system for emergency evacuation events.
